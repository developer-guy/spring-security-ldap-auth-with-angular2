# Spring Security Ldap Authentication and Angular2 


## Getting Started

If we need to explain the project , these project is based on Spring Security LDAP Authentication and the frontend-side Angular2.

Firstly,Spring provide us an embedded LDAP server then we use that for our authentication.So create login form using 
Angular2 to handle authentication by sending post request to /login endpoint which is provided by Spring Security.

See for the LDAP Server config : [LdapSecurityConfiguration.java](https://github.com/developer-guy/spring-security-ldap-auth-with-angular2/blob/master/backend/src/main/java/com/ldapauth/config/LdapSecurityConfiguration.java)

### Prerequisites

You should be sure npm installed on the system.

### Installing

Firstly you should run mvn clean install commond on frontend project because the backend project serves the frontend project by this way.

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests


### And coding style tests


## Deployment
